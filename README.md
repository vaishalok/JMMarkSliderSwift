How to Install it
------------
JMMarkSliderSwift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "JMMarkSliderSwift"
```

#### Classic and ancient way
Copy into your project the following file:
`JMMarkSlider.swift`

How to use it? 
------------
#### First way (User Interface):

Add an UISlider outlet to your view using the User Interface and set `JMMarkSlider` as the custom class. All the exposed properties are marked with **@IBInspectable**, so you can customize them in storyboard's attributes inspector and preview it directly. 

Link it with the outlet property if you want to access its properties:

@IBOutlet weak var firstSlider: JMMarkSlider!

Simply customize it! (take a look at -Customization- section)
```
firstSlider.markColor = UIColor(white: 1, alpha: 0.5)
firstSlider.markPositions = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
firstSlider.markWidth = 1.0
firstSlider.selectedBarColor = .gray
firstSlider.unselectedBarColor = .black
```

#### Second way (Using code):
```
var secondSlider: JMMarkSlider!
```

Instantiate and customize it (again, take a look at -Customization- section). Finally add it to the desired view as usual:
```
secondSlider = JMMarkSlider()
secondSlider.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 200, width: 284, height: 31)
secondSlider.markColor = UIColor(white: 1, alpha: 0.5)
secondSlider.markPositions = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
secondSlider.markWidth = 1.0
secondSlider.selectedBarColor = .gray
secondSlider.unselectedBarColor = .black
view.addSubview(secondSlider)
```

Setting the marks
------------
You can set the marks using a percentage system from 0 to 100. Set all the marks in the `markPositions array` property:
```
firstSlider.markPositions = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
```

Customization
------------
Here you can see a bunch of parameters that you can change:

#### Marks
- `markColor` : UIColor  - Customize the color of the marks.
- `markWidth`: Float - Customize the width of the marks.
- `markPositions`: [Float] - Set in a percentage system from 0 to 100 where the marks should be placed.

#### Bar colors
- `selectedBarColor`: UIColor - Customize the color of the selected side of the slider.
- `unselectedBarColor`: UIColor - Customize the color of the unselected side of the slider.

#### Handler.
- `handlerColor`: UIColor - Customize the color of the handler.
- `handlerImage`: UIImage  - Set a custom UIImage for the handler.
